Bachelorthesis Mathematics

This is a simple collection of various .jl files used to create the plots for my Bachelorthesis Codim-2 bifurcations in a predator-prey system.

The files are not organized in any hierarchy, but rather are supposed to be copy-pasted and run in the julia-repl, as there was no need for a clean module like structure.
